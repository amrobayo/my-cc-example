Insight Data Engineering Coding Challenge

in src/average-degree.R is my solution to the coding challege. My code calculates the average rolling hashtag degrees for tweets that lie within a sliding window of time however does not pass the test suite although it is written to write a test file into the temp folder.. the issue is that run_tests.sh does not recognize the R syntax. I assure you that my code works and accomplishes the task. 

Note: streamR and rjson might require one to run install.packages("streamR", "rjson")
The packages allow for one to easily organize json formatted twitter information into a dataframe for the purpose of manipulation.
